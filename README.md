This is a repo for 'Workshop in Databases' course I took, where we created a social network in the topic of Netflix shows. 
The site is running on top PHP, and use MySQL database for information.

# How to run
- clone repo, and follow the steps in '/datasets' , '/posters extractor' and 'table creator' where you will be creating the requried database tables.
- When MySQL server is running, get to root folder of the repo and run 'PHP -S localhost:12345' to open PHP web server over localhost:12345. 
- In web browser, enter 'localhost:12345/sadna_project' to get to front page.
